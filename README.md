# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The goal of this course project is to make a tidy version of the data collected
from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. This dataset is collected from 
the UCI Machine Learning repository. 
 

###The repository contains the following files :
- This README.md file
- A codebook called "CodeBook.md" which describe variables of the final tidy dataset
- The tidy dataset called "tidyData.txt"  
- A R file called "run_analysis.R" which contains the script of the project. This script achieves 
the following tasks :
  1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  6. Building a codebook describing all variables of the tidy dataset
